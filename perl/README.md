vtwsclib - vtiger CRM Web service client Library
=======

**coreBOS** does not have support for PERL Client Webservice Library. Nobody has taken responsibility for this code.

This directory contains a copy of a version made available for our parent code base, vtiger CRM version 5.2, which should work in general but may not.

We [found this code here](http://search.cpan.org/~monsenhor/WebService-Vtiger-1.01/lib/WebService/Vtiger.pm) and copied it to this project to make it easier to find and as a historical reference and starting point for anybody who may need it.

You are more than welcome to pick this up and help out. We will give you all the support and help we can.

**Thank you** very much for your help and contribution.

*coreBOS Team*
